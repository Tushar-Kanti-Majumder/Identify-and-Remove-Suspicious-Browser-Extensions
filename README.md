# Identify-and-Remove-Suspicious-Browser-Extensions
To complete the task of identifying and removing suspicious browser extensions, I began by reviewing the extension manager in **Mozilla Firefox**. I carefully checked for any installed extensions, thoroughly reviewing each one to assess its permissions and trustworthiness. During this process, I specifically noted that **I did not have any extensions installed**, neither suspicious nor normal. Despite this, I proceeded with the entire process as outlined, including researching the types of malicious extensions that can harm users by stealing personal data, injecting ads, or installing malware. After confirming the absence of any extensions, I followed the steps of checking permissions, reviewing potential risks, and restarting the browser. Finally, I documented every step taken and compiled the information into a comprehensive **PDF report**, which includes my findings, the steps I followed, and a detailed explanation of why no extensions were removed. Even though there were no extensions to remove, I ensured that I completed every part of the task in detail.
